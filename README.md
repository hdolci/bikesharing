# Bike Sharing

The purpose of this analysis is to learn the type of customer who uses the bike sharing as well as when they use it. We will use data provided by Citiâ€™s bike-sharing program for August 2019. The data will be slightly modified using Pandas prior to connecting to Tableau.

## Results
Results can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/huy.do2575/viz/Book2_16317634396970/Story1?publish=yes) as a Tableau story.

 
## Summary

Based on findings using Tableau, we found that a majority of users are also subscribers of the bike sharing service as opposed to one-off users. The busiest times are 7AM - 9AM and 4PM - 8PM. This is possibly due to both commuters and tourists using the bikes at the same time. We also were able to find out that users are mostly males.
